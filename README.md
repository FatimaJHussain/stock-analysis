# Overview of Project (VBA_CodeRefactoring)
This project is to describe the benefits of code refactoring. Firstly, code is written for Stock analysis, and time to run the code is captued. Afterwards, same code is modified and code refactoring is done. Once again, time to run the code is measured and two results are compared.  

# Results
## Without Code Refactoring:
When code is run for the first time (without code refactoring), stock analysis for years 2017 and 2018 is performed. Time taken for the code to run for year 2017 and 2018 is 0.515625 seconds and 0.4609375 seconds, respectively. This is shown in the Figure-1 ![without_refactoring_2017](https://github.com/FatimaJHussain/stock-analysis/blob/main/without_refactoring_2017.png), and  Figure-2 ![without_refactoring_2018](https://github.com/FatimaJHussain/stock-analysis/blob/main/without_refactoring_2018.png)
## With Code Refactoring:
When code is refactored and time to run for stock analysis is done, we see improved results. Time to run the code for years 2017 and 2018 are 0.1210938 seconds and 0.1171875 seconds, respectively. As shown in Figure-3![VBA_Challenge_2017](https://github.com/FatimaJHussain/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)and Figure-4![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://github.com/FatimaJHussain/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png).
# Summary
We can see the running time of a code is decreased, when code is refactored.
## Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code 
Refactoring improves the design of a code, and makes it easly readable. It can also help us to find bugs and also helps in executing the code faster. Moreover, code is managable and easily extendible.
## Advantages and Disadvantages of original/refactored VBA script 
In original VBA script, code was simple but lengthy. We have reused the code many times and therefore, time to run the code was longer.  While in refactored VBA script, instead of time to run the code is improved. However, it becomes somewhat complicated by introducing various nested FOR and IF loops. We have to be very careful in code writing as we can make mistakes very essily, while dealing with lots of FOR and IF statements.
